# TopoJSON of Colombia's departments

In this repo I provide Python notebooks that document the work I performed to create a TopoJSON file of Colombia's departments to be used in Power BI as a shape map.

## Getting started

Please make sure to install Python and the project requirements. The requirements are listed in the file `requirements.txt` and can be installed in a Linux terminal with the following command:[^1]

[^1]: Note the `python -m` at the beggining of the command. While running `pip` this way inside a virtual environment is not necessary, it's good practice to run it this way. See [Why you should use `python -m pip`](https://snarky.ca/why-you-should-use-python-m-pip/) for an explanation about running `pip` with and without `python -m`.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can do the same with the file `dev-requirements.txt`. This file lists some linting and code formatting libraries that can be used with a source-code editor like VS Code.

## Notebooks

### modify_map

This notebook documents an exploration work aimed at understanding what kind of information was contained in a TopoJSON of Colombia's towns and departments downloaded from Internet. The idea was to extract the information linked only to departments.

While I was able to extract such information, there were some visualization issues related to the archipelago of San Andr√©s, Providencia and Santa Catalina. In particular, the archipelago looks pretty small and far from mainland. While this reflects reality, it isn't visually appealing. Figure 1 below shows the result.

The notebook can be found in the folder **existing_topojson_map**.

### create_map

This notebook documents the work that solves the visualization issues with the archipelago mentioned above. This work can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Get a GeoJSON of Colombia's departments
2. Move the archipelago islands closer together
3. Increase the archipelago size
4. Move the archipelago closer to mainland
5. Convert the updated GeoJSON to TopoJSON

Figure 2 below shows the result.

The notebook can be found in the folder **new_topojson_map**.

I highly appreciate feedback and you can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://bit.ly/jaime-linkedin) any time. I'm also working on other projects. Check this out in my [personal website](https://bit.ly/jaime-website).

Thanks for reading!
