# TopoJSON of Colombia's departments

In this repo I provide Python notebooks that document the work I performed to create a TopoJSON file of Colombia's departments to be used in Power BI as a shape map. This file improves the visualization of a particular deparment so that it looks larger and closer to mainland.

I'm planning a future update to create a TopoJSON file of Colombia's towns with the same visualization improvement.

## Getting started

Please make sure to install Python and the project requirements. The requirements are listed in the file `requirements.txt` and can be installed in a Linux terminal with the following command:[^1]

[^1]: Note the `python -m` at the beggining of the command. While running `pip` this way inside a virtual environment is not necessary, it's good practice to run it this way. See [Why you should use `python -m pip`](https://snarky.ca/why-you-should-use-python-m-pip/) for an explanation about running `pip` with and without `python -m`.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can do the same with the file `dev-requirements.txt`. This file lists some linting and code formatting libraries that can be used with a source-code editor like VS Code.

To make sure the notebooks work properly, you have to:

1. Run the notebook `modify_map.ipynb` (located in the folder **existing_topojson_map**). This will create the file `mapa_departamentos.json` that is used in step 3
2. Download the GeoJSON file mentioned in the notebook `create_map.ipynb` (located in the folder **new_topojson_map**) and place it in the same folder where the notebook is
3. Run the notebook `create_map.ipynb`

## Notebooks

### modify_map

This notebook documents an exploration work aimed at understanding what kind of information was contained in a TopoJSON of Colombia's towns and departments downloaded from Internet. The idea was to extract the information linked only to departments.

While I was able to extract such information, there were some visualization issues related to the archipelago of San Andr√©s, Providencia and Santa Catalina. In particular, the archipelago looks pretty small and far from mainland. While this reflects reality, it isn't visually appealing. Figure 1 below shows the result.

### create_map

This notebook documents the work that solves the visualization issues with the archipelago mentioned above. This work can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Get a GeoJSON of Colombia's departments
2. Move the archipelago islands closer together
3. Increase the archipelago size
4. Move the archipelago closer to mainland
5. Convert the updated GeoJSON to TopoJSON
